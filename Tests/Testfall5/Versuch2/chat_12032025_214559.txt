user: Create a map that displays all wind turbines in Germany and the density of wind turbines (wind turbines/km²) per federal state. Use the Fisher-Jenks classification with six classes to visualize the density. The density polygons should include information about the density, the total number of wind turbines, as well as the name and area (km²) of each federal state.
assistant: The map displaying the density of wind turbines (wind turbines/km²) per federal state in Germany has been successfully created. The map uses the Fisher-Jenks classification with six classes to visualize the density. Each polygon on the map represents a federal state and includes information about the density, the total number of wind turbines, the name, and the area in square kilometers of each state.
