user: Create a map that displays all wind turbines in Germany and the density of wind turbines (wind turbines/km²) per federal state. Use the Fisher-Jenks classification with six classes to visualize the density. The density polygons should include information about the density, the total number of wind turbines, as well as the name and area (km²) of each federal state.
