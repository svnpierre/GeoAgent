user: Determine the mean annual rainfall for each german federal state and visualize the results using state boundaries. Ensure that both the calculated rainfall values and the state names are included.
assistant: The visualization of the mean annual rainfall for each German federal state has been successfully created. The map uses a blue color scheme to represent the rainfall values, with darker shades indicating higher rainfall. The states are clearly outlined, and the mean annual rainfall values for each state are included in the visualization.
