This GeoDataFrame provides comprehensive weather-related information across multiple stations, with some columns containing missing values.
user: Determine the mean annual rainfall for each german federal state and visualize the results using state boundaries. Ensure that both the calculated rainfall values and the state names are included.
assistant: The visualization of the mean annual rainfall for each German federal state using state boundaries has been successfully created. The map displays the federal states with color coding representing the mean annual rainfall in millimeters.
